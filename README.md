# FieldTools
FieldTools calculated electric Fields in MD trajectories. It requires an Amber trajectory and parameter file as input. FieldTools can optionally read in user-defined charges, e.g. from QM/MM calculations. QMChargesTools can be used to calculate ChelpG charges for QM regions over the trajectory. 

The code is based on Stuyver et al., J Comp Chem 2019.
